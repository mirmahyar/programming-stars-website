            Hello to every curious person, exploring this programming world ! You have chosen the right place to explore
            the infinite space in which many programming languages shine, just like stars in our infinite universe !
            Today, programming languages help shape our world ! And this is something new in the history of mankind! More programming
            languages out there result in more productivity and creativity. Unlike in the 80s or even 90s, when programmers
            had only one or two choices when starting a project, today, programmers have a vast variety of languages and tools to choose
            from. And this, has resulted in a very vibrant software ecosystem that we have today.
            In this website, we have prepared a collection of programming languages and their main characteristics. The list is
            by no means exhaustive, but it will gradually be more complete. ;
